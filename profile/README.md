# 🌟 Finance Friends 🌟

## 📚 Overview
Finance Friends is a gamified platform designed to teach children about financial literacy through engaging and interactive methods. Our project combines innovative AI technology with a user-friendly interface to create an educational yet fun experience for kids. 

### 🌈 Key Features
- **Gamified Learning Experience**: Children embark on a journey with 6 main characters across 6 unique locations, each focusing on different financial modules including financial mathematics, credits, savings, investments, taxes, and free conversation.
- **Interactive Chatbot Education**: Kids interact with a chatbot powered by Node.js, MongoDB, and Python scripts using LangChain. The chatbot guides them through predefined lessons, explaining a self-created curriculum in an understandable and engaging manner.
- **On-Demand Learning**: At any point, children can pause the chatbot and ask questions related to the curriculum, making learning flexible and responsive.
- **Quizzes and Competitions**: Users take quizzes at certain checkpoints, accumulating points. A score above 50% is required to proceed, fostering a competitive yet educational environment.
- **Child-Friendly Interface**: The platform is fully interactive and designed specifically for children, making learning about finances enjoyable and accessible.
